# Surf the Market.
## StockSurfer is a stock screener designed for retail and DIY investors.

StockSurfer is a full-stack web app built using **React, Express, and MongoDB.**  
The app also uses **d3.js** for visualization and **Passport.js with OAuth 2.0** for authentication.

StockSurfer lets users browse through stocks that fit their desired criteria. After  
signing in, users can save stocks to their personal collection for later review.

This is the back-end portion of the project. See the main repo at https://github.com/henryliang2/stock-surfer
